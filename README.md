# Hotel Booking Analysis

## Project Overview

In the Hotel Booking Analysis project, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about hotel bookings. The objective of the analysis was to draw meaningful conclusions and insights about trends and patterns in hotel bookings and how various factors interplay in the booking process.

## Objective

The main objective of this project was to conduct EDA on the hotel bookings dataset to gain insights into customer behaviors, preferences, booking patterns, and other factors that influence the hotel booking process.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of hotel booking information and contains the following features:

- Hotel type (City or Resort)
- Cancellation status (Canceled or Not Canceled)
- Lead time (days between booking and arrival)
- Arrival date details (year, month, week number, day of month)
- Length of stay (weekend nights and weeknights)
- Guest demographics (adults, children, babies)
- Meal type, country of origin, market segment
- Distribution channel, repeat guest status
- Booking changes, deposit type
- Room type information
- Agent and company IDs
- Days in waiting list, customer type
- Average daily rate (ADR), special requests
- Reservation status and date

## Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

The data preprocessing steps included:

- Removing duplicate rows
- Handling null values in different columns
- Converting columns to appropriate data types
- Removing outliers
- Creating new columns to capture relevant information

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The analysis was conducted by exploring various aspects of the dataset and answering important questions:

- Booking trends based on hotel type
- Preferred room types and their impact on Average Daily Rate (ADR)
- Popular meal choices
- Distribution of bookings across hotels
- Booking channels and their popularity
- Busy months for hotels
- Guest demographics based on origin
- Stay duration trends
- Revenue generation analysis
- Lead time impact on bookings
- Factors influencing booking cancellations
- Trends within a month

## Data Visualization

The analysis was supported by visualizations including:

- Bar plots
- Histograms
- Scatter plots
- Pie charts
- Line plots
- Heatmaps
- Box plots

## Conclusion

The Hotel Booking Analysis project provided valuable insights into the booking patterns, preferences, and behaviors of hotel guests. Key takeaways include trends in booking cancellations, preferred booking channels, seasonal trends, customer demographics, and factors influencing revenue generation.

The analysis highlighted the significance of factors like booking lead time, room type, and guest demographics in the hotel booking process. These insights can be leveraged by hotels to enhance their services, target specific customer segments, and optimize revenue generation strategies.
